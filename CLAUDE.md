# Alpha Academy

Native iOS trainer for the NATO/ICAO phonetic alphabet. SwiftUI, iPhone only,
portrait, deployment target iOS 16.

## Project layout

The Xcode target uses `PBXFileSystemSynchronizedRootGroup`. New `.swift` files and
new subfolders under `newApp/newApp/` are compiled automatically — **never edit
`project.pbxproj` to add files.** The same applies to resources: any `.otf`, `.json`,
or stray file left in that tree ships in the bundle.

Build and verify:

```
xcodebuild -project newApp/newApp.xcodeproj -scheme newApp \
  -sdk iphonesimulator -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,name=iPhone 17 Pro' build
```

A DEBUG self-check exercises the whole data pipeline (spaced repetition, the commit
funnel, streaks, achievements, persistence, callsign derivation):

```
SIMCTL_CHILD_AA_SELF_CHECK=1 xcrun simctl launch --console-pty booted j.newApp
```

QA can jump straight to a tab or a training mode:

```
SIMCTL_CHILD_AA_INITIAL_TAB=chart SIMCTL_CHILD_AA_INITIAL_MODE=encode \
  xcrun simctl launch booted j.newApp
```

## Design System

Always read DESIGN.md before making any visual or UI decision.
All font choices, colors, spacing, and aesthetic direction are defined there.
Do not deviate without explicit user approval.
In QA mode, flag any code that doesn't match DESIGN.md.

Three rules from DESIGN.md that are violated most often, so check them explicitly:

- **Exactly one `hot` button per screen.** A second one means the IA is wrong.
- **Exactly one `paper` (light) surface per screen**, reserved for the letter.
- **Every numeral the user reads is IBM Plex Mono with tabular figures.** No exceptions.
